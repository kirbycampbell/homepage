Hello!

This project is my Homepage which is viewable live at [JKirbyCampbell.com](https://jkirbycampbell.com).
At this location, I am hosting my Resume, Project Portfolio, Blog, and Bio. It's my homebase if you are interested in my work and/or learning more about me.

Feel free to contact me at jkirbycampbell@gmail.com for job inqueries.

I built this app using React Hooks, lots of Javascript functions, custom CSS animations & interactions, and its hosted on AWS.
An example of the custom javascript & animations can be best seen in [Titles.js](https://github.com/kirbycampbell/homepage/blob/master/src/Containers/Titles.js) from this project.
These timer hooks that connect to css changes affect components like in [BarBoxes.js](https://github.com/kirbycampbell/homepage/blob/master/src/Containers/BarBoxies.js).
